DESIGN

- centre tiles one screen resize
- footer space on left side at larger screen
- make buttons not ugly
- show filters button overlap - potentially move to heading
- padding of content on body pages'
- potentially add 'show filters' button header, would then have to close header on each page. 

QUERIES
- addtional queries for course and standard information
	- internal/external
	- lit/num
	- eotc

-calculation of differant credit types (lit, num, vocational pathways etc.)
- could adjust search query to show course code and also partial search (searching 'Maori' would show Maori even if it's nto the start of the course ('Te Reo Maori'))

PAGES
- editing of information
- potential login and edit feature, can edit from backend

FUNCTIONALITY
